-- Tracking Customer Spendings with Rolling 30 Days

-- # You work for the analytics team of a DVD rental company. Management wants to see how much `each customer spends within any rolling 30-day` 
-- period. This means for each payment record, you should `calculate the sum of all payments made by that same customer in the 30 days leading 
-- up to and including that payment date`. The list should still `include all individual payments with their dates`, `but with an extra column 
-- showing this rolling total`.

-- You should handle cases where customers make multiple payments on the same day, ensuring theyâ€™re all counted correctly. 
-- Results should be sorted by customer_id and payment_date in ascending order.


-- Problem Solving
-- To analyze customers' spendings, problem requires to investigate over customers' payments and their rolling spendings totals for each 
-- 30 day period for each spending including that payment.
-- Also we need to serve each payment amount and date information with that extra information.
-- Despite payment table has customer related infromation to join two tables, back then there was a warning about dublicate payments. 
-- Thus rental table will be used as an intermediate table to join payment and customerr informations
--      # Rental table has customer information (rental.customer_id) that we can join rental and customer tables
--      # Payment table has rental information (payment.rental_id) that we can join payment and rental tables
